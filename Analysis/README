Set of scripts to exctract absorption spectra from MD trajectories.

We follow the procedure:
1) Calculate the average structure from each trajectory and then make average structure from these averages - tcl_vmd/average_writer.tcl
2) Align all trajetories to reference averaged frame and output transformation matrix for it - tcl_vmd/bow_before_queen.tcl
3) Rotate dipole moment outputed during MD by transformation matrix from step 2. - tcl_vmd/rot_dip_vectors.tcl
4) Sum the induced dipoles of AMOEBA and permanent dipoles - python/sumUpDipoles.py
5) Produce the spectra by fft of coeficients of autoregressive model of dipole moment evolution python/projectProcessor_openmm.py
