Set of scripts to exctract absorption spectra from MD trajectories.

We follow the procedure:
1) Align all trajetories to reference structure and output transformation matrix for it and permanent dipole moment evolution - tcl_vmd/align_and_output.tcl
2) Rotate dipole moment outputed during MD by transformation matrix from step 1. - tcl_vmd/rot_dip_vectors.tcl
3) Sum the induced dipoles of AMOEBA and permanent dipoles - python/sumUpDipoles.py
4) Produce the spectra by fft of coeficients of autoregressive model of dipole moment evolution python/projectProcessor_openmm.py

NOTE:
Required external python packages: numpy, pandas, spectrum, scipy
